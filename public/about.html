  <h1 class="heading">About Me</h1>
<p class="abouttext">I’m a 1st-year Mechanical Engineering student at NIT Agartala, exploring the intersection of Web Development and Artificial Intelligence. My focus is on building projects that blend smart user experiences with modern AI tools—while constantly learning and sharing with others along the way.

Currently strengthening my skills in C++, DSA, HTML/CSS, and JavaScript, and diving into React, Python, and AI APIs to bring real-world ideas to life. Whether it's creating a simple app or experimenting with AI-powered features, I believe every project is a step forward.

I’m aiming for meaningful internships in software/AI roles and actively building a portfolio that reflects curiosity, collaboration, and consistency. I value teamwork, enjoy helping peers, and believe that growth is something we can all achieve together.

Let’s connect and grow—one project, one conversation at a time.</p></section>
